# About
<!-- <p style='text-align: justify;'>  -->
Choosing as an interdisciplinary study field where you have to be good at Mathematics, Biology, Computer Science, and Statistics simultaneously is a daunting decision. You find yourself in a pickle when it is being offered for the very first time. Similarly, when I started Bachelor's in Bioinformatics, nothing was streamlined in as it was in other majors, which were already established over several years. I had to struggle a lot. Studying Bioinformatics at the undergraduate level in Pakistan could only take me so far. However, I learned one of the most interesting facts about all living organisms on this earth: all the information about living beings is already present in their DNA; all we need to get is the skill to decode this information. Such a skill can enable us to make predictions about any organism even before it’s born. The realization of this fact has a huge impact on my life. After completing my bachelor's degree I still needed to find answers to many questions. I am interested in pursuing a career in academia so I will start Masters in Bioinformatics soon and ultimately I will go for a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics.

There is a huge gap in this field. I want to make this convoluted field Bioinformatics easy and streamlined for those who are new to this field. Teaching is an art and only having a lot of knowledge about a subject is not the only key for being a good teacher. My passion for teaching led me to do a double major (Bioinformatics and Education) during my bachelor’s degree. This platform [Bioinformatics Guy](/) is the continuation of my passion for teaching where the core concepts of Bioinformatics have been explained in the simplest form through easy to understand video tutorials.
