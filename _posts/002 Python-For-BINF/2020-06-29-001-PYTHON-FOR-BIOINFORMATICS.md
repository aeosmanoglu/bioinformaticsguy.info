<!-- I am back with a brand new videoseries so let me tell you this I'm notgonna get in this outfit for the wholeseries but this is just to tell you thatI am also from the field of MedicalSciences and I know the difficulties andthe problems that biologists have toface whenever they try to learn a newprogramming language so if you are abiologist and you want to learn a newprogramming language you were at theright place in this video we are goingto learn a new programming language nowthis is a billion dollar question whichprogramming language they should learnit's in human nature that we like to gofor the stuff which is hard andattractive and everybody likes to talkabout that kind of stuff so let's tryGoogle Trends to find out who's hotthese days in programming languagesGoogle Trends let's start by searchingC++ since you might be watching thevideo from any part of the world let'schange it to worldwide okay there isthis butter of compare let's comparewith the languagehow about Java whoo there is a lot ofdifference between Java and C++ and Javais way more famous than C++ let's tryanother language is even less popularthan Java let's try another languagehow about Perl OhPerl is the least famous programminglanguage these days so let's try anotherone and I think that this programminglanguage is gonna win and his name isPYD too and python Ohso you can see that python is on the topof every other programming language youcan see this purple graph so now we knowwho's hot these days the next questionthat will arise in your mind is thatbeing about it is I don't have theprerequisites of programming skills ofdigital skills my math is terribleand in the realm of biology you mightalso think that I don't have thoseprogramming geek genes but when I do sothis is a valid question and I have agood news for you the good news isPython is one of the most easiestprogramming languages it's just likewriting something in English not onlythis I will also be explainingeverything with the examples taken frombiological sciences so by the end ofthis course you will be an expert inPython and you will also be able toimplement this in biological sciencesall you need is a working machine and amindset to achieve this goal so what areyou waiting for let's install Python nowin order to install Python just searchpython download click the first link ifyou want install for windows click herefor linux click here for mac click hereand for other go there so i already havea copy i'm gonna cancel it out and let'spull that copy out to the desktopalright so you will get an icon likethis double click it and click run sonow over here you just have to checkthis part because this is very importantand it will come in handy in future wecan get away with the Install Now buttonjust click here so it's gonna take awhile I'm gonna speed it up this processonce installation is complete you willsee something like this click closeonce it's installed go to the start andsearch ID yeaheither you have to click here and thisis the Python interpreter it might notlook just like this in your computer butit will look similar so let's try it ourfirst line of code prin hello to theworld of bioinformatics I hope myspelling the correct and you just havehit enter to print the statement and itis printed yay so we have done this incomeso let's say you don't have a computerin hand and all you have is a mobilephone or gaming console so so we haveanother solution for you you all youneed is a Google Drivego read Google Account go to your GoogleDrive once it's loaded click this newbutton and then go over here and themore and then select this Google Colabatteryit's gonna take some violent loading forthe very first time you can rename itprint helloand you can write the same code overhere and it will work just as fine helloto the world of bioinformatics and thenyou have to click this button to runthis code it might take some timebecause it has to allocate and connectfor the first time but once it'sconnected its boom done in just a secondyay it is printed so now you can untieporn on the go even on your mobile phoneit's that easy we will formally startfrom the next video so subscribe to keepan eye on the videos and that's all youneed to do so if you have any ideascomments questions or concerns just letme know in the comments down below thankyou very much for watching and I willsee you around in the next video[Music]  -->
