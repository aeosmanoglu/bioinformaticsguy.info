 <!-- how you doing guys bioinformatics guy
here with another video of the series
python for bioinformatics
in this video we will be talking about
the simple values the simple values
include
booleans integers floats special values
and the most important values strings
so let's get started so let's start by
opening our
idl e the first value is the boolean
value which is also known as logical
values i know in one of your exams you
have attempted this question in which
you have to write true or false
this is the same thing so t r u
e true or f a l s e false
these are the two values true or false
you can check the type of this value by
using this function t by p e type
and then enter true and this is a case
sensitive value if you will enter wrong
spellings just like here
you will get an error if you will keep
this first t
small you will also get in here t r u e
you will also get an error so we will
talk about the use of this value in the
future videos
so the next value is integers integers
are just like numbers 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so on and so forth
these also include negative numbers so 1
2
3 this is a number 1 is a number 2 is a
number
and you can check the type of this by
the same function
type and enter an integer over here
so here are some examples -1
[Music]
you can also enter a really huge numbers
like this
and you can notice that separators such
as commas or periods are not used in
python
you will just get a plain number and we
are going to use these numbers in later
videos
so the next type is float float is the
abbreviated version of the term flooring
point
so float is basically equivalent of
scientific notation and you might be
already familiar with such number
these are known as floats because these
contain a digit and an exponent
exponent is adjusted so that the decimal
point floats just after the first digit
so here are some
examples 2.5 0.0001
and this is a very huge float
and as you can see that when you will
enter a really huge float
it is represented in this e form
right over here and you can check its
type by using the same function
type and enter a float over here 1.2
and its float the next is special value
it is special because it is no value it
is basically used when you have missing
values in the data
and it is represented by n o n e none
see even if you enter over here you get
nothing so let's talk about strings we
will be using this type a lot in this
series
can you make a grasp why strings are so
important in the series
please pause the video and make guess in
the comments down below
so this type of simple value is used to
enter text in python
so it has to be enclosed in single
quotes
or double quotes we enter it in triple
quotes for multiple lines
so here is our first example of the
string
python 4 bioinformatics
so let me tell you the reason why we
will be using strings a lot in our
series the reason is that we will be
working with the dna
rna based sequences and amino acid
sequences
which are in the form of text and we
will be needing help from the strings to
enter those in python so let us take
some example of entering amino acid
sequences in python it's like
m and k m d
l m and k
[Music]
so we have entered a protein sequence
let's try entering a dna sequence a t
g c t c t c d c g a c
g a c d a t
so we have entered a dna sequence if you
have to enter a multiple line sequence
you can enter it in triple quotes in the
next video we will be talking about
expressions which
include numerical operators logical
operations and a very important string
operation so if you have any questions
or concerns about this video
don't hesitate to comment down below you
can always find me there for help
if you want to find out what i do other
than programming please check out my
vlogging channel
thank you very much for watching and i
will see you around in the next video
